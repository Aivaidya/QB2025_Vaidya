## OVERVIEW

In this exercise, we will explore aspects of local or site-specific diversity, also known as alpha ($\alpha$) diversity. 
First we will quantify two of the fundamental components of ($\alpha$) diversity: **richness** and **evenness**.
From there, we will then discuss ways to integrate richness and evenness, which will include univariate metrics of diversity along with an investigation of the **species abundance distribution (SAD)**.

## 1) R SETUP

In the R code chunk below, please provide the code to: 
1) Clear your R environment,
2) Print your current working directory,
3) Set your working directory to your `Week-2/` folder folder, and
4) Load the `vegan` R package (be sure to install first if you have not already).

>```{r}
getwd()
setwd("/cloud/project/QB2025_Vaidya/Week2-Alpha")
reuire(vegan)



```

## 2) LOADING DATA

In the R code chunk below, do the following:
1)Load the BCI dataset, and 
2) Display the structure of the dataset (if the structure is long, use the max.level = 0 argument to show the basic information).

```{r}

>data(BCI)
str(BCI, max.level = 0)
```

## 3) SPECIES RICHNESS

**Species richness (S)** refers to the number of species in a system or the number of species observed in a sample.

### Observed richness

In the R code chunk below, do the following:

1. Write a function called `S.obs` to calculate observed richness

2. Use your function to determine the number of species in `site1` of the BCI data set, and

3. Compare the output of your function to the output of the `specnumber()` function in `vegan`.

```{r}
data(BCI)
S.obs <- function(site) {
  return(sum(site > 0))
}

> observed_richness <- S.obs(BCI[1, ])
vegan_richness <- specnumber(BCI[1, ])
vegan_richness
vegan_richness <- specnumber(BCI[1, ])
vegan_richness




```

***Question 1***: Does `specnumber()` from `vegan` return the same value for observed richness in `site1` as our function `S.obs`?
What is the species richness of the first four sites (i.e., rows) of the BCI matrix?

> ***Answer 1***:
>Yes both first four sites present same values of  1  2  3  4 
93 84 90 94 
```{r}
S.obs <- function(site) {return(sum(site > 0))}
 observed_richness <- S.obs(BCI[1, ])
 vegan_richness <- specnumber(BCI[1, ])
 observed_richness
 richness_custom <- apply(BCI[1:4, ], 1, S.obs)
 richness_custom
 richness_vegan <- specnumber(BCI[1:4, ])
 richness_vegan
 
```


### Coverage: How well did you sample your site?

In the R code chunk below, do the following:

1. Write a function to calculate Good's Coverage, and

2. Use that function to calculate coverage for all sites in the BCI matrix.
>
```{r}
> Goods_Coverage <- function(site) { N <- sum(site)
F1 <- sum(site == 1)
if (N == 0) {
    return(NA) }
    else { return(1 - (F1 / N)) }}  
#function to all sites in BCI
coverage_values <- apply(BCI, 1, Goods_Coverage)
coverage_values






```
  
***Question 2***: Answer the following questions about coverage:

a.  What is the range of values that can be generated by Good's Coverage? 
b.  What would we conclude from Good's Coverage if $n_{i}$ equaled *N*?
c.  What portion of taxa in `site1` was represented by singletons? 
d.  Make some observations about coverage at the BCI plots.

> ***Answer 2a***: Good’s Coverage ranges between 0 and 1.
>

> ***Answer 2b***:
>Good’s Coverage is defined as:𝐶=1-(F1/N)
Since F1 is the number of singletons i.e observed only once , while
N is the total number of individuals observed, then F=0 means C=1, suggesting perhaps a complet dataset where none appear only once suggesting high completedness.

> ***Answer 2c***: 
> Thus a lower fraction of o.33 observed for the code below suggests the specieswas observed several times.
```{r}
>site1 <- BCI[1, ] 
F1 <- sum(site1 == 1)
N <- sum(site1 > 0)
singleton_fraction <- F1 / N
singleton_fraction
```

> ***Answer 2d***: 
>Since majority of them are more than 0.8 on the Good's coverage
```{r}
Goods_Coverage <- function(site) {
N <- sum(site) 
F1 <- sum(site == 1)
if (N == 0) {
    return(NA) 
} else {
    return(1 - (F1 / N))
  }
}
#for all sites in BCI
coverage_values <- apply(BCI, 1, Goods_Coverage)
summary(coverage_values)
hist(coverage_values, main = "Distribution of Good's Coverage in BCI Sites",
     xlab = "Good's Coverage", col = "lightblue", border = "black")


```


### Estimated richness

In the R code chunk below, do the following:

1. Load the microbial dataset (located in the `Week-2/data` folder),

2. Transform and transpose the data as needed (see handout),

3. Create a new vector (`soilbac1`) by indexing the bacterial OTU abundances of any site in the dataset,

4. Calculate the observed richness at that particular site, and 

5. Calculate coverage of that site

```{r}
soilbac.t <- as.data.frame(t(soilbac))
soilbac1 <- soilbac.t[1, ]
N_soilbac1 <- sum(soilbac.t$T1_1)
N_soilbac1
observed_richness <- sum(soilbac1 > 0)
observed_richness
singleton_count <- sum(soilbac1 == 1)
total_reads <- sum(soilbac1)
coverage <- 1 - (singleton_count / total_reads)
coverage



```

***Question 3***: Answer the following questions about the soil bacterial dataset. 

a.  How many sequences did we recover from the sample `soilbac1`, i.e. *N*? 
b.  What is the observed richness of `soilbac1`? 
c.  How does coverage compare between the BCI sample (`site1`) and the KBS sample (`soilbac1`)?

> ***Answer 3a***:
>0
```{r}
soilbac.t <- as.data.frame(t(soilbac))
soilbac1 <- soilbac.t[1, ]
N_soilbac1 <- sum(soilbac.t$T1_1)
N_soilbac1

```

> ***Answer 3b***: 
>1074
```{r}
observed_richness <- sum(soilbac1 > 0)
observed_richness
```

> ***Answer 3c***: 
> It is 0 for BCI sample (site1) while 0.648 for KBS sample soilbac1.
```{r}
t.BCI <- t(BCI)
 site1 <- t.BCI[1, ]
 singleton_count_site1 <- sum(site1 == 1)
 total_reads_site1 <- sum(site1)
 coverage_site1 <- 1 - (singleton_count_site1 / total_reads_site1)
 coverage_site1
 soilbac.t <- as.data.frame(t(soilbac))
  soilbac1 <- soilbac.t[1, ]
 singleton_count_soilbac1 <- sum(soilbac1 == 1)
 total_reads_soilbac1 <- sum(soilbac1)
 coverage_soilbac1 <- 1 - (singleton_count_soilbac1 / total_reads_soilbac1)
 coverage_soilbac1
 



```



### Richness estimators

In the R code chunk below, do the following:

1. Write a function to calculate **Chao1**,

2. Write a function to calculate **Chao2**, 

3. Write a function to calculate **ACE**, and

4. Use these functions to estimate richness at `site1` and `soilbac1`. 

```{r}

 >S.chao1 <- function(x) { 
  S.obs <- specnumber(x)  
  Q1 <- sum(x == 1)  
  Q2 <- sum(x == 2)  
  if (Q2 == 0) {
    return(S.obs)  
  } else {
    return(S.obs + (Q1^2) / (2 * Q2))
  }
}

> S.chao2 <- function(site, SbyS) { SbyS <- as.data.frame(SbyS)
+ x <- SbyS[site, ]
+ SbyS.pa <- (SbyS > 0) * 1
+ Q1 <- sum(colSums(SbyS.pa) == 1)
+ Q2 <- sum(colSums(SbyS.pa) == 2)
+ S.obs <- specnumber(x)
+ if (Q2 == 0) {
+ S.chao2 <- S.obs
+ } else {
+ S.chao2 <- S.obs + (Q1^2) / (2 * Q2)
 }
+ return(S.chao2)
 }
 

> S.ace <- function(x, thresh = 10) {
+ x <- x[x > 0]
+ S.abund <- sum(x > thresh)
+ S.rare <- sum(x <= thresh)
+ singlt <- sum(x == 1)
+ N.rare <- sum(x[which(x <= thresh)])
+ if (N.rare == 0) {
+ return(S.abund)  
 }
+ 
+ C.ace <- 1 - (singlt / N.rare)
+ i <- 1:thresh 
+ count <- function(i, y) sum(y == i)
+ a.1 <- sapply(i, count, x)
+ f.1 <- sum(i * (i - 1) * a.1)
+ G.ace <- (S.rare / C.ace) + (singlt / C.ace) * max(f.1 / (N.rare * (N.rare - 1)), 0)  
+ 
+ return(G.ace)
}


>BCI.t <- as.data.frame(t(BCI))
 site1 <- t.BCI[1, ]
 cat("Richness estimates for site1 (BCI):\n")
 cat("Chao1:", S.chao1(site1), "\n")
cat("Chao2:", S.chao2("site1", t.BCI), "\n")
cat("ACE:", S.ace(site1), "\n")




```

***Question 4***: 
What is the difference between ACE and the Chao estimators? 
Do the estimators give consistent results? 
Which one would you choose to use and why?

> ***Answer 4***:
>Chao1 estimates species richness by counting rare species in abundance data, while Chao2 looks at presence-absence across samples. ACE, on the other hand, separates common and rare species using a set cutoff (usually 10) and considers how often species appear. These methods can give different results—Chao estimators are more cautious and work best when data is incomplete, while ACE is more reliable when species vary in how often they show up. Choosing the right method depends on the data; Chao1 is better when many species are missing, while ACE works well when species are found at different frequencies.


### Rarefaction

In the R code chunk below, please do the following:

1. Calculate observed richness for all samples in `soilbac`,

2. Determine the size of the smallest sample,

3. Use the `rarefy()` function to rarefy each sample to this level,

4. Plot the rarefaction results, and

5. Add the 1:1 line and label.


```{r}
>S.obs <- function(x = ""){
rowSums(x > 0) + 1
}
S.obs(soilbac.t)
C <- function(x = ""){
1 - (rowSums (x ==1)/ rowSums(x))
}
smallest_sample_size <- min(rowSums(soilbac))
smallest_sample_size
soilbac.S <- S.obs(soilbac.t)
 min.N <- min(rowSums(soilbac.t))
 S.rarefy <- rarefy(x=soilbac.t, sample = min.N, se = TRUE)
 rarecurve(x = soilbac.t, step = 20, col = "blue", cex = 0.6, las = 1)
 abline(0,1, col = 'red')
 text(1500, "1:1", pos=2, col = 'red')





```


## 4) SPECIES EVNENNESS
Here, we consider how abundance varies among species, that is, **species evenness**.

### Visualizing evenness: the rank abundance curve (RAC)
One of the most common ways to visualize evenness is in a **rank-abundance curve** (sometime referred to as a rank-abundance distribution or Whittaker plot).
An RAC can be constructed by ranking species from the most abundant to the least abundant without respect to species labels (and hence no worries about 'ties' in abundance). 

In the R code chunk below, do the following:

1. Write a function to construct a RAC,

2. Be sure your function removes species that have zero abundances, 

3. Order the vector (RAC) from greatest (most abundant) to least (least abundant), and 

4. Return the ranked vector

```{r}
> construct_RAC <- function(abundance_vector) {
+ abundance_vector <- abundance_vector[abundance_vector > 0]
+ ranked_vector <- sort(abundance_vector, decreasing = TRUE)
+ return(ranked_vector)
 }

> RAC <- function(x = ""){
x.ab = x[x>0]
x.ab.ranked = x.ab[order(x.ab, decreasing = TRUE)]
as.data.frame(lapply(x.ab.ranked, unlist))
return(x.ab.ranked)
}



```

Now, let us examine the RAC for `site1` of the BCI data set.

In the R code chunk below, do the following:

1. Create a sequence of ranks and plot the RAC with natural-log-transformed abundances,

2. Label the x-axis "Rank in abundance" and the y-axis "log(abundance)"

```{r}


> plot.new()
site1 <- BCI[1, ]
   rac<- RAC( x = site1)
ranks <- as.vector(seq(1, length(rac)))
opar <- par(no.readonly = TRUE)
par(mar = c(5.1, 5.1, 4.1, 2.1))
plot(ranks, log(rac), type = 'p', axes = F,
xlab = "Rank in abundance", ylab = "Abundance", 
las = 1, cex.lab = 1.4, cex.axis = 1.25)
    box()
axis(side = 1, labels = T, cex.axis =1.25)
axis(side = 2, las =1, cex.axis =1.25,
labels = c(1,2,5,10,20), at = log(c(1,2,5,10,20)))







```

***Question 5***: What effect does visualizing species abundance data on a log-scaled axis have on how we interpret evenness in the RAC?

> ***Answer 5***:
> Using a log scale on a Rank Abundance Curve (RAC) makes it easier to see how evenly species are distributed in a community. Without a log scale, the most common species can dominate the graph, hiding the less common ones. With the log scale, the differences between rare species become clearer. A steep slope on a log scale means some species are way more abundant than others (low evenness), while a flatter slope means the species are more evenly distributed (high evenness). Basically, it helps us see the whole picture, not just the key players within.

Now that we have visualized unevennes, it is time to quantify it using Simpson's evenness ($E_{1/D}$) and Smith and Wilson's evenness index ($E_{var}$).

### Simpson's evenness ($E_{1/D}$)

In the R code chunk below, do the following:

1. Write the function to calculate $E_{1/D}$, and

2. Calculate $E_{1/D}$ for `site1`.

```{r}
>SimpE <- function(x = ""){
S <- S.obs(x)
x = as.data.frame(x)
D <- diversity(x, "inv")
E <- (D)/S
return(E)
}
site1 <- BCI [1, ]
SimpE(site1)








```

### Smith and Wilson's evenness index ($E_{var}$)

In the R code chunk below, please do the following:

1. Write the function to calculate $E_{var}$,

2. Calculate $E_{var}$ for `site1`, and

3. Compare $E_{1/D}$ and $E_{var}$.

```{r}

>Evar <- function (x){
x <- as.vector(x[x>0])
1- (2/pi) * atan(var(log(x)))
}
Evar(site1)




```

***Question 6***: Compare estimates of evenness for `site1` of BCI using $E_{1/D}$ and $E_{var}$.
Do they agree? If so, why? If not, why? What can you infer from the results.

> ***Answer 6***:
The values SimpE = 0.42 and Evar = 0.51 both measure how evenly species are spread out in the community. SimpE suggests that the species are somewhat uneven, with a few being more dominant. On the other hand, Evar is a bit higher, meaning the species are more evenly spread out when you consider both the number of species and their abundance. So, overall, Evar shows a slightly more balanced distribution of species in site1 compared to SimpE. Since $E_{1/D}$ is less than $E_{var}$, it might mean few species are taking over, even if there are lots of species overall.

## 5) INTEGRATING RICHNESS AND EVENNESS: DIVERSITY METRICS

So far, we have introduced two primary aspects of diversity, i.e., richness and evenness.
Here, we will use popular indices to estimate diversity, which explicitly incorporate richness and evenness.
We will write our own diversity functions and compare them against the functions in `vegan`. 

### Shannon's diversity (a.k.a., Shannon's entropy)

In the R code chunk below, please do the following:

1. Provide the code for calculating H' (Shannon's diversity),

2. Compare this estimate with the output of `vegan`'s diversity function using method = "shannon".

```{r}
ShanH <- function (x= "") {
H =0
for (n_i in x){
if (n_i >0){
p = n_i / sum(x)
H = H - p*log(p)
}
}
return(H)
}

diversity(site1, index = "shannon")

SimpD <- function (x = ""){
D=0
N= sum(x)
for (n_i in x){
D= D+ (n_i^2)/(N^2)
}
return(D)
}
D.inv <- 1/SimpD(site1)
D.sub <- 1-SimpD(site1)
diversity(site1, "inv")
diversity(site1, "simp")




```

### Simpson's diversity (or dominance)

In the R code chunk below, please do the following:

1. Provide the code for calculating D (Simpson's diversity),

2. Calculate both the inverse (1/D) and 1 - D,

2. Compare this estimate with the output of `vegan's` diversity function using method = "simp".

```{r}
>SimpD <- function (x = ""){
D=0
N= sum(x)
for (n_i in x){
D= D+ (n_i^2)/(N^2)
}
return(D)
}
D.inv <- 1/SimpD(site1)
D.sub <- 1-SimpD(site1)
diversity(site1, "inv")
diversity(site1, "simp")













```

### Fisher's $\boldsymbol\alpha$

In the R code chunk below, please do the following:

1. Provide the code for calculating Fisher's $\boldsymbol\alpha$,

2. Calculate Fisher's $\boldsymbol\alpha$ for `site1` of BCI.

```{r}
>rac <- as.vector(site1[site1 >0])
invD <- diversity(rac, "inv")
invD
Fisher <- fisher.alpha(rac)
Fisher
C1 <- data.frame (t(rep(1,500))); colnames(C1) <- paste("sp" , 1:500)
C2 <- data.frame(t(c(rep(1, 250)))); colnames(C2) <- paste("sp", 1:250)
H1 <- diversity (C1, index = 'shannon')
H2 <- diversity (C2, index ='shannon')
H1; H2
H_all <-matrix(ncol =2, nrow = 1000)
for (i in 1:1000){
C <- data.frame(t(rep(1, i)))
colnames(C) = paste ("sp", 1:i)
H_all[i, 1] <- 1
H_all[i, 2] <- diversity(C, index = 'shannon')
}
plot(H_all[ ,1], H_all[ , 2], xlab = "Species Richness', ylab = "Shannon Diversity (entropy)")




```

***Question 7***: 
How is Fisher's $\boldsymbol\alpha$ different from $E_{H'}$ and $E_{var}$? 
What does Fisher's $\boldsymbol\alpha$ take into account that $E_{H'}$ and $E_{var}$ do not?

> ***Answer 7***:Fishers  $\boldsymbol\alpha$ is lower than  $E_{H'}$ and $E_{var}$, suggests there arent that many species to begin with, as Fisher's $\boldsymbol\alpha$ generally looks at the number of different species, while $E_{H'}$ is thrown off by the number of dominant species, while $E_{var}$ denotes how evenly the data is distributed. Fisher's alpha talks about how many species are part of the community, thus being concerned about the richness of the data, while the other two are mainly concerned about the evenness or normality of the data, without being much concerned about the total number of species. 

## 6) HILL NUMBERS 

Remember that we have learned about the advantages of Hill Numbers to measure and compare diversity among samples. 
We also learned to explore the effects of rare species in a community by examining diversity for a series of exponents $q$. 

***Question 8***: Using `site1` of BCI and `vegan` package, a) calculate Hill numbers for $q$ exponent 0, 1 and 2 (richness, exponential Shannon's entropy, and inverse Simpson's diversity). b) Interpret the effect of rare species in your community based on the response of diversity to increasing exponent $q$. Fishers

> ***Answer 8a***: q=0(richness) is 93; q=1(exponential Shannon's entropy) is 55.6 while q=2 (inverse Simpson's diversity) is 0.025. Since q0 is more than q1, many rare species exist contributing to the species richness but not as much to the species evenness. Now, since q1 is also more than q2, even within the abundant species, there are far less that are significantly dominant.Since q1 and q2 are very far apart, they are not dominated by rare species.
>
> ***Answer 8b***: As the hill numbers reduce to increasing exponent $q$ Fishers means rare species make up large portion of the community but they dont contribute the species abundance.
>

##7) MOVING BEYOND UNIVARIATE METRICS OF $\alpha$ DIVERSITY

The diversity metrics that we just learned about attempt to integrate richness and evenness into a single, univariate metric.
Although useful, information is invariably lost in this process. 
If we go back to the rank-abundance curve, we can retrieve additional information -- and in some cases -- make inferences about the processes influencing the structure of an ecological system.

## Species abundance models

The RAC is a simple data structure that is both a vector of abundances.
It is also a row in the site-by-species matrix (minus the zeros, i.e., absences). 

Predicting the form of the RAC is the first test that any biodiversity theory must pass and there are no less than 20 models that have attempted to explain the uneven form of the RAC across ecological systems.

In the R code chunk below, please do the following:

1. Use the `radfit()` function in the `vegan` package to fit the predictions of various species abundance models to the RAC of `site1` in BCI,

2. Display the results of the `radfit()` function, and 

3. Plot the results of the `radfit()` function using the code provided in the handout.

```{r}
>RACresults <- radfit(site1)
plot.new()
plot(RACresults, las = 1, cex.lab = 1.4, cex.axis = 1.25)



```


***Question 9***: Answer the following questions about the rank abundance curves:
a) Based on the output of `radfit()` and plotting above, discuss which model best fits our rank-abundance curve for `site1`?
b) Can we make any inferences about the forces, processes, and/or mechanisms influencing the structure of our system, e.g., an ecological community?

> ***Answer 9a***: 
>
> ***Answer 9b***:
>


***Question 10***: Answer the following questions about the preemption model:
a.  What does the preemption model assume about the relationship between total abundance (*N*) and total resources that can be preempted?
b.  Why does the niche preemption model look like a straight line in the RAD plot?

> ***Answer 10a***: 
>
> ***Answer 10b***:
>


***Question 10***: Why is it important to account for the number of parameters a model uses when judging how well it explains a given set of data?

> ***Answer 11***:
>

## SYNTHESIS

1.  As stated by Magurran (2004) the  ${D = } \sum p_i^2$ derivation of Simpson's Diversity only applies to communities of infinite size. 
For anything but an infinitely large community, Simpson's Diversity index is calculated as ${D = } \sum \frac{n_i(n_i -1)} {N(N-1)}$. 
Assuming a finite community, calculate Simpson's D, 1 - D, and Simpson's inverse (i.e. 1/D) for `site 1` of the BCI site-by-species matrix. 

2.  Along with the rank-abundance curve (RAC), another way to visualize the distribution of abundance among species is with a histogram (a.k.a., frequency distribution) that shows the frequency of different abundance classes.
For example, in a given sample, there may be 10 species represented by a single individual, 8 species with two individuals, 4 species with three individuals, and so on.
In fact, the rank-abundance curve and the frequency distribution are the two most common ways to visualize the species-abundance distribution (SAD) and to test species abundance models and biodiversity theories.
To address this homework question, use the R function **hist()** to plot the frequency distribution for `site 1` of the BCI site-by-species matrix, and describe the general pattern you see.

3.  We asked you to find a biodiversity dataset with your partner.
This data could be one of your own or it could be something that you obtained from the literature. 
Load that dataset.
How many sites are there?
How many species are there in the entire site-by-species matrix?
Any other interesting observations based on what you learned this week?
